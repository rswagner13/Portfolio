### 📝 Description
---
<p align="center">
  This is a portfilio website that I built for myself as my Unit 1 Project. It contains a home page, a page providing some background information about myself, a page that contains a version of Wordle, and a page that has links to my socials and resume.

### 🧔‍♂️👩 User Stories
* As a friend of Mour, I really want to see what it's like being a software engineer and what kind of cool projects he's been working on.
* As a hiring manager, I want to see what the candidate has created and feels is important to show to others. From there, I can obtain an understanding of the candidate's understanding of software engineering and if they're able to do the work we need to them do.

### ⚠️❌💫 Unsolved Problems/Major Hurtles
---
* It took me a while to grasp the game logic for Wordle. Part of that can be attributed to poor planning, and spending more time than needed on the web pages.
* Placement and spacing of my website isn't quite how I want it to be. Most of it has to do with using flex boxes and grids. This is something that will get easier the more I practice
  
### ▶️ Next Steps
--- 
* Add a function to my Wordle game that will compare number of letters players guess vs the computer's guess (ie if the player guess "boots" and the computer chose "donut", only the first "o" would be colored.)
* Refractor Wordle code
* Add another game to my website
* Fix the layout of the website, maybe even make it a single page rather than multiple pages
